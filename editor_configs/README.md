# What are these?

These configs are examples used for setting up your editor for writing lua workflows and plugins.
This is not for development of ImgScal itself.

* LSP configs for lua should be placed in the top level directory you have open for development.
  * This can be inside the main imgscal directory, or in each workflow/plugin directory.
* `.ignore` is for the main imgscal directory. This prevents unneeded files from showing up in your fuzzyfinder.
